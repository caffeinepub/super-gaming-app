  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to useGameControls.ts hook implementing keyboard event handlers for WASD and arrow keys. The implementation adds keydown/keyup listeners that update key state and includes preventDefault() to avoid browser defaults. The hook manages key state tracking for all requested control keys and properly cleans up event listeners. All acceptance criteria for REQ-6 appear to be addressed in the implementation.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest and REQ-6 only specify WASD and arrow keys for directional movement. Space bar control was not requested and appears to be an additional feature not mentioned in the requirements.",
