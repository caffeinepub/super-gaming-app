# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix non-functional keyboard direction controls (WASD and arrow keys) for player movement in the 3D game.

**Planned changes:**
- Debug and repair keyboard input handling for WASD keys (W=forward, A=left, S=backward, D=right)
- Debug and repair keyboard input handling for arrow keys
- Ensure player movement responds immediately to key presses
- Ensure player movement stops when keys are released
- Fix any issues preventing consistent movement during gameplay

**User-visible outcome:** Players can control their character using WASD or arrow keys with immediate, responsive movement that works consistently throughout gameplay.
